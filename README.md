The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is among the most disturbed biomes on Earth and qualifies as a biodiversity hotspot due to its incredible biodiversity and the threats it faces. 
In recent decades, conservation awareness considerably increased, pushing several institutions to recognize both its value and the damage incurred. 
Consequently, protected areas have been established, and various restoration projects initiated. 
Iracambi Research and Conservation center is a Brazilian NGO committed to Atlantic Forest conservation since 1990. Over the years, Iracambi has employed diverse techniques 
to restore the Atlantic Forest. Initially, eucalyptus trees were planted and exploited for paper and charcoal production, still existing within the landscape. 
Some areas were actively reforested, while others were left to naturally regrow after being fenced off from bare land.
Furthermore, in our study, we classified the oldest forest patches as primary forests to be used as a control category for the assessment of biodiversity, and we also included 
the montane forest as a control category for the disturbance analysis. Our goal was to assess the efficiency of different restoration practices for biodiversity recovery, 
assuming they have different degrees of disturbance. Using an ecosystem approach, we estimated the level of biodiversity from tree and mammal diversity, collecting data 
through forest plots and camera traps, respectively. Moreover, we applied linear regression models to investigate possible relationships between ecological variables: 
biodiversity, aboveground biomass and altitude.
